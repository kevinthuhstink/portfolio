TODO
EMPHASIZE DESIGN AND EASE OF USE

Eventually
    Move .css to .scss
    Fill your projects page with more work
    More animations using js? might not be suitable
    Be more selective with your fonts
    Dark mode with inverted colors

1.0
    There should be two sections: the title, and work/projects
    Format the title
        A sharp looking background with a negative color effect would be cool
        Leave github, linkedin, other contacts here but small
        Opening animation
            Upper "curtain" div scrolls past, revealing a dotted border, the qr code and kevinthuhstink.com
            when it's done drop the divs, lower goes down and upper goes up
        Title styling
            Brutalism
            Hand symbolism inspired by Evangelion
                Reach into and grab the ball?
    Format the projects of the website
        Maintain a similar theme to the title
        aboutme should resonate with your cover letter
        Keep your github, linkedin, and other links at the bottom for people to reach out
        Include a button at the bottom of the page to head to the next page
        Include your resume
        Make your projects extravagant
            Be the show-off

    The three parts should be coherent so I can plan transitions between the pages later
    Make each individual project go almost fullscreen with a description
