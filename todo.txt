EMPHASIZE DESIGN AND EASE OF USE

1.0
    There should be three sections: the title, about me, and work/projects
    Format the title
        A sharp looking background with a negative color effect would be cool
        Leave github, linked, other contacts here but small
        Opening animation
            Line splits the screen down the middle and opens into the title
        Title animation
            Take inspo from that bocchi edit
            A model with words cycling around it and electric spewing out
            Lorna Shore audio visualizer
    Format the body of the website
        Keep your github, linkedin, and other links at the bottom for people to reach out
        Include a button at the bottom of the page to head to the next page
    Format the projects
        Follow the same structure of the body

    The three parts should be coherent so I can plan transitions between the pages later
    Implement closing and opening of the curly braces
    Make projects go almost fullscreen with a description
