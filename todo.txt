EMPHASIZE DESIGN AND EASE OF USE

1.0
    Format the body of the website
        Have a sidebar on the left and the rest be the body
            Intentionally misalign your name
        Keep your github, linkedin, and other links at the bottom for people to reach out
            For now they can be text-anchored but eventually switch to img-anchored
    Title page will come later
    Responsiveness will come later
        ie. make sidebar a dropdown instead on mobile
