TODO
EMPHASIZE DESIGN AND EASE OF USE

Eventually
    Move .css to .scss
    Fill your projects page with more work
    More animations using js? might not be suitable
    Be more selective with your fonts
    Dark mode with inverted colors

1.0
    There should be two sections: the title, and work/projects
    Format the title
        A sharp looking background with a negative color effect would be cool
        Leave github, linkedin, other contacts here but small
        Opening animation
            Upper "curtain" div scrolls past, revealing a dotted border, the qr code and kevinthuhstink.com
            when it's done drop the divs, lower goes down and upper goes up
        Title styling
            Brutalism
            Hand symbolism inspired by Evangelion
                Reach into and grab the ball?

    Format the projects of the website
        Maintain a similar theme to the title
        Bubbles that the user can scroll through
            When they click on one, expand that to fit a screen
                Maybe make it the background
            Include a description of the project accordingly
                Maybe open with the project and then open with a side bar
                with extra details about the project that can be opened or closed
        Always include links to the other pages on the bottom

    Have also an aboutme page
        aboutme should resonate with your cover letter
        Include your resume

    The three parts should be coherent so I can plan transitions between the pages later
    Make each individual project go almost fullscreen with a description
